# SSW Angular Music Store
### Set up your visual studio 2015
1. Install Visual Studio 2015

3. Install npm globally
        Run the following commands

3. Install typescript and gulp globally so we can use them anywhere

		- npm install typescript gulp -g

4. Install ASP.Net 5 
	follow the instructions on http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/getting-started/installing-on-windows.html
